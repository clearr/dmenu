This is a fork of dmenu (http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) with my personal
configuration. The original README is README.orig.

* List of patches applied

  * vertfull

    Available at the official: http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/vertfull

  * normprompt

    Use norm{bg,fg} color for the prompt instead of sel{bg,fg}color.

  * xywp

    Based on xyw patch, which is available at the official:
    http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/xyw

    This adds ability to use percentages in -x, -y and -w option as follows:

        dmenu -x 50% -y 50% -w 25%

    When you use percentages in -x/-y option, the horizontal/vertical center of
    the menu window (instead of the top-left corner) is located at the specified
    position.

    xyw patch must already be applied before applying this patch
    (patch/dmenu-xywp-RELEASE.diff, RELEASE is the release version of dmenu).
